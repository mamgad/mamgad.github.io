I\u0026rsquo;m juggling two complex projects (Project Alpha and Project Beta), and every PM tool I tried felt like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.\nThe core issues:\n🧠 Context switching kills me: Jumping between tools breaks my flow state 📝 I forget everything: What was I working on? Why did this matter? 🔥 Hyperfocus then chaos: I\u0026rsquo;ll code for 6 hours straight, then lose track for days 📊 Manual updates? Yeah right: If it\u0026rsquo;s not automatic, it\u0026rsquo;s not happening What I needed was basically an AI assistant that could:\nRemember what I was doing and why Track my progress without me thinking about it Help me prioritize when my brain is all over the place Work with my chaotic workflow, not against it The Solution: An AI Assistant That Actually Gets It # I built my own AI assistant using Claude Code + Obsidian. Think of it as having a really smart teammate who never sleeps, never forgets context, and actually understands how chaotic brains work.\nStep 1: Obsidian as My External Brain # MyVault/ ├── Daily Notes/ # Brain dumps and daily check-ins ├── Projects/ # Alpha, Beta, PersonalBlog ├── Templates/ # Consistent structure └── scripts/ # Automation magic The key insight: Structure without rigidity. I can dump thoughts anywhere, and the system helps me organize later.\nThe magic part? When I ask Claude to create tasks and projects, Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s graph view automatically shows all the connections between my notes, tasks, and projects. No manual linking required - just ask Claude to organize something, and boom, the visual web of my work appears.\nNote: Actual project and task names are hidden for privacy. All examples in this post use dummy data.\nStep 2: Claude Code as My AI Sidekick # This is where the magic happens. I created custom slash commands so my AI assistant can:\n/show-tasks - \u0026ldquo;What should I work on?\u0026rdquo;\nSorts everything by urgency and priority Shows me what\u0026rsquo;s actually on fire vs what can wait No more staring at endless lists wondering where to start /daily-check-in - My scattered brain\u0026rsquo;s best friend:\nAutomatically detects what I did (using git commits!) Asks 3 simple questions about progress Remembers context so I never lose track of what I was doing Step 3: The Task Format That Saved My Sanity # - [ ] Fix login bug @task-20250810-001 (due:: 2025-08-16) (priority:: P1) (project:: Alpha) - status:: not-started - estimate:: 2d - notes:: Users can\u0026#39;t authenticate, breaks entire flow Why this works for scattered brains:\nUnique IDs: Nothing gets lost in my brain fog Machine readable: My AI can sort and prioritize automatically Context preserved: I remember WHY things matter Step 4: Git as My Accountability Partner # The genius move: git commits don\u0026rsquo;t lie about what I actually did.\ngit log --since=\u0026#34;yesterday\u0026#34; --oneline # Shows real progress git diff HEAD~1 -- Projects/ # Detects completed tasks No more guilt about \u0026ldquo;what did I even do today?\u0026rdquo; - git remembers everything.\nHow It Actually Works: My Daily Flow # Morning: \u0026ldquo;/daily-check-in\u0026rdquo; # My AI shows me:\nWhat I actually accomplished yesterday (from git) What\u0026rsquo;s due today (sorted by panic level) Any blockers I mentioned before I answer 3 questions, and boom - I know exactly what to focus on.\nDuring Work: \u0026ldquo;/show-tasks\u0026rdquo; # When my brain goes \u0026ldquo;wait, what was I doing?\u0026rdquo; - I just ask my AI. It shows me everything sorted by urgency, no thinking required.\nEvening: Automatic Progress Tracking # Every commit I make gets tracked. No manual updates, no guilt about forgetting to log progress.\nThe ADHD-Friendly Workflow # Brain Dump → Organization → Action # Messy thoughts go in daily notes (zero friction) AI assistant helps organize when I\u0026rsquo;m ready Smart prioritization tells me what actually matters Automatic tracking keeps me accountable Real Example: Managing Two Complex Projects # Currently juggling:\nProject Alpha: Performance-focused app (Go + React) Project Beta: AI-enhanced platform (Django + React) Instead of losing track of everything, my AI assistant shows me:\n🚨 Due Tomorrow: - [ ] Fix database performance issue @task-20250810-001 (Alpha) 📅 This Week: - [ ] Add user authentication @task-20250810-002 (Beta) - [ ] Optimize API endpoints @task-20250810-003 (Alpha) My ADHD brain sees \u0026ldquo;3 clear things to focus on\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;overwhelming chaos.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat I Learned: ADHD-Friendly Design Principles # 1. Reduce Cognitive Load # One place to dump all thoughts AI figures out organization later Clear visual priorities (red = urgent, green = chill) 2. Automate the Boring Stuff # Git commits = automatic progress tracking No manual status updates required Smart reminders based on actual behavior 3. Work WITH ADHD, Not Against It # Hyperfocus: Let me code uninterrupted, track everything automatically Scattered: Clear, simple prioritization when I need direction Forgetful: Context preservation so I never lose track The Results: My ADHD Brain Finally Has A Co-Pilot # Before: Scattered thoughts, forgotten tasks, constant guilt about productivity\nAfter: Clear priorities, automated tracking, an AI assistant that actually gets my workflow\nThe Real Impact # No more lost context: I can hyperfocus for hours, then instantly remember where I was Guilt-free breaks: Git history shows I actually am productive, even when it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like it Clear direction: When my brain is scattered, /show-tasks tells me exactly what matters Automatic accountability: Progress tracking happens in the background Why This Works for ADHD # Traditional productivity advice: \u0026ldquo;Just use a planner and stick to it!\u0026rdquo;\nADHD reality: My brain doesn\u0026rsquo;t work that way.\nThis system works because it:\nMeets me where I am (scattered, forgetful, hyperfocused) Automates the boring stuff (tracking, organizing, prioritizing) Preserves context (so I never lose the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo;) Provides clear direction (when I need it) Gets out of my way (when I don\u0026rsquo;t) Live Examples: See the System in Action # Smart Task Creation Demo # Here\u0026rsquo;s what happens when I casually mention a new task:\nMe: \u0026#34;My manager gave me a new task to build a PoC for a quantum calculator\u0026#34; Claude: I\u0026#39;ll help you create a new task for the quantum calculator PoC. First, let me check what projects you have and create the appropriate project structure. I need to ask you a few questions before creating the task: 1. **Due date:** When does your manager need this quantum calculator PoC completed? 2. **Priority:** How urgent is this compared to your other work? (P1=Critical, P2=High, P3=Normal, P4=Low) 3. **Project:** Should this be part of an existing project (CyWAF, Nexus) or should I create a new \u0026#34;QuantumCalculator\u0026#34; project for it? Once you provide these details, I\u0026#39;ll create the properly formatted task using the hybrid format and generate the next available task ID. Why this is genius: Claude automatically asks for missing critical information (due date, priority, project) instead of creating incomplete tasks. No more \u0026ldquo;when was this due again?\u0026rdquo; moments later.\n/show-tasks Command Demo # ## 📋 Task Overview | Status | Project | Task Description | Due Date | Days | |---------|-----------------|------------------------------|------------|------| | 🚨🔴 | EcommerceApp | Complete Payment Gateway... | 2025-08-11 | -1 | | 📆🟡 | MobileApp | Sync with iOS Team about... | 2025-08-16 | 4 | | 📆🔴 | DataPipeline | Implement Data Encryption... | 2025-08-16 | 4 | | 📆🟢 | Analytics | Add Dashboard Export... | 2025-08-16 | 4 | | 📆🟡 | DevOps | Run Database Migration... | 2025-08-16 | 4 | | 📆🟢 | Portfolio | Deploy Portfolio Website... | 2025-08-17 | 5 | | 📆🟡 | QuantumCalc | Build PoC for Quantum... | 2025-08-18 | 6 | **📊 Summary:** 7 total • 🚨 1 overdue • 📆 6 this week ## 🚨 Overdue Tasks - **EcommerceApp**: Complete Payment Gateway Integration (1 day overdue) 🔴 ## 📆 Due This Week - **MobileApp**: Sync with iOS Team about Push Notifications (4 days) 🟡 - **DataPipeline**: Implement Data Encryption at Rest (4 days) 🔴 - **Analytics**: Add Dashboard Export Feature (4 days) 🟢 - **DevOps**: Run Database Migration Script (4 days) 🟡 - **Portfolio**: Deploy Portfolio Website to Production (5 days) 🟢 - **QuantumCalc**: Build PoC for Quantum Calculator (6 days) 🟡 What I see at a glance: \u0026ldquo;One thing is on fire 🚨, focus on that first.
